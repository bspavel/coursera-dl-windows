Generous contributions by educators and institutions are\r\nmaking excellent education available to many who could not afford it otherwise.\r\nThere are even non-profits with \"feet on the ground\" in remote areas of the\r\nworld who are helping spread the wealth.\r\n\r\nThis utility makes it easier to batch download lecture resources (e.g., videos, ppt,\r\netc) for Coursera classes.  Given one or more class names and account credentials,\r\nit obtains week and class names from the *lectures* page, and then downloads\r\nthe related materials into appropriately named files and directories.\r\n\r\nWhy is this helpful?  A utility like [wget][2] can work, but has the\r\nfollowing limitations:\r\n\r\n1. Video names have numbers in them, but this does not correspond to\r\n    the actual order.  Manually renaming them is a pain that is best left\r\n    for computers.\r\n2. Using names from the syllabus page provides more informative names.\r\n3. Using `wget` in a for loop picks up extra videos which are not\r\n    posted/linked, and these are sometimes duplicates.\r\n\r\nBrowser extensions like *DownloadThemAll* is another possibility, but\r\n`coursera-dl` provides more features such as appropriately named files.\r\n\r\nThis work was originally inspired in part by [youtube-dl][3] by which\r\nI've downloaded many other good videos such as those from Khan Academy.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n  * Support for both regular (i.e., time-based) courses as well as on-demand\r\n    courses.\r\n  * Intentionally detailed names, so that it will display and sort properly\r\n    on most interfaces (e.g., [VLC][4] or MX Video on Android devices).\r\n  * Regex-based section (week) and lecture name filters to download only\r\n    certain resources.\r\n  * File format extension filter to grab resource types you want.\r\n  * Login credentials accepted on command-line or from `.netrc` file.\r\n  * Core functionality tested on major new Windows editions.\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\n\r\n`coursera-dl` is meant to be used only for your material that Coursera gives\r\nyou access to download.\r\n\r\nWe do not encourage any use that violates their [Terms Of Use][20]. A\r\nrelevant excerpt:\r\n\r\n> \"[...] Coursera grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable\r\n> license to access and use the Sites. You may download material from the\r\n> Sites only for your own personal, non-commercial use. You may not\r\n> otherwise copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, commercially\r\n> exploit or otherwise transfer any material, nor may you modify or create\r\n> derivatives works of the material.\"\r\n\r\n*Note:* You must already have (manually) agreed to the Honor of Code of the\r\nparticular courses that you want to use with `coursera-dl`.\r\n\r\n## Create an account with Coursera\r\n\r\nIf you don't already have one, create a [Coursera][1] account and enroll in\r\na class. See https://www.coursera.org/courses for the list of classes.\r\n\r\n## Running the script\r\n\r\nRun the exe to download the materials by providing your Coursera account\r\ncredentials (e.g. email address and password or a `~/.netrc` file), the\r\nclass names, as well as any additional parameters:\r\n\r\n    General:                     coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> modelthinking-004\r\n    On-Demand course:            coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> --on-demand calculus1\r\n    Multiple classes:            coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> saas historyofrock1-001 algo-2012-002\r\n    Filter by section name:      coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> -sf \"Chapter_Four\" crypto-004\r\n    Filter by lecture name:      coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> -lf \"3.1_\" ml-2012-002\r\n    Download only ppt files:     coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> -f \"ppt\" qcomp-2012-001\r\n    Use a ~/.netrc file:         coursera-dl -n -- matrix-001\r\n    Get the preview classes:     coursera-dl -n -b ni-001\r\n    Specify download path:       coursera-dl -n --path=C:\\Coursera\\Classes\\ comnetworks-002\r\n    Display help:                coursera-dl --help\r\n\r\n**Note:** Some of the options like `-sf` and `-f` may not work with on-demand courses.\r\nDownloading on-demand courses are mutually exclusive with regular courses.\r\n\r\n    Maintain a list of classes in a dir:\r\n      Initialize:              mkdir -p CURRENT/{class1,class2,..classN}\r\n      Update:                  coursera-dl -n --path CURRENT `\\ls CURRENT`\r\n\r\nNote that we *do* support the new On Demand classes. You have to use the\r\noption `--on-demand` for that purpose. You also have to download those\r\nclasses *separately* for regular, time-based classes.\r\n\r\nUse of a `~/.netrc` file is a good alternative to\r\nspecifying both your username (i.e., your email address) and password every\r\ntime on the command line. To use it, simply add a line like the one below to\r\na file named `.netrc` in your home directory (or the [equivalent][8], if you\r\nare using Windows) with contents like:\r\n\r\n    machine coursera-dl login <user> password <pass>\r\n\r\nCreate the file if it doesn't exist yet.  From then on, you can switch from\r\nusing `-u` and `-p` to simply call `coursera-dl` with the option `-n`\r\ninstead.  This is especially convenient, as typing usernames (email\r\naddresses) and passwords directly on the command line can get tiresome (even\r\nmore if you happened to choose a \"strong\" password).\r\n\r\n## Resuming downloads\r\n\r\nIn default mode when you interrupt the download process by pressing\r\n<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, partially downloaded files will be deleted from your disk and\r\nyou have to start the download process from the begining. If your\r\ndownload was interrupted by something other than KeyboardInterrupt\r\n(<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) like sudden system crash, partially downloaded files will\r\nremain on your disk and the next time you start the process again,\r\nthese files will be discraded from download list!, therefore it's your\r\njob to delete them manually before next start. For this reason we\r\nadded an option called `--resume` which continues your downloads from\r\nwhere they stopped:\r\n\r\n\tcoursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> --resume sdn1-001\r\n\r\nThis option can also be used with external downloaders:\r\n\r\n\tcoursera-dl --wget -u <user> -p <pass> --resume sdn1-001\r\n\r\n*Note 1*: Some external downloaders use their own built-in resume feature\r\nwhich may not be compatible with others, so use them at your own risk.\r\n\r\n*Note 2*: Remember that in resume mode, interrupted files **WON'T** be deleted from\r\nyour disk.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: If your password contains punctuation, quotes or other \"funny\r\ncharacters\" (e.g., `<`, `>`, `#`, `&`, `|` and so on), then you may have to\r\nescape them from your shell. With bash or other Bourne-shell clones (and\r\nprobably with many other shells) one of the better ways to do so is to\r\nenclose your password in single quotes, so that you don't run into\r\nproblems.  See [issue #213][issue213] for more information.\r\n\r\n# Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nIf you have problems when downloading class materials, please try to see if\r\none of the following actions solve your problem:\r\n\r\n* Make sure the class name you are using corresponds to the resource name\r\n  used in the URL for that class:\r\n    `https://class.coursera.org/<CLASS_NAME>/class/index`\r\n\r\n* To download an On Demand course, use the `--on-demand` option of the\r\n  program.\r\n\r\n* Have you tried to clean the cached cookies/credentials with the\r\n  `--clear-cache` option?\r\n\r\n* Note that many courses (most, perhaps?) may remove the materials after a\r\n  little while after the course is completed, while other courses may retain\r\n  the materials up to a next session/offering of the same course (to avoid\r\n  problems with academic dishonesty, apparently).\r\n  <br><br>\r\n  In short, it is not guaranteed that you will be able to download after the\r\n  course is finished and this is, unfortunately, nothing that we can help\r\n  you with.\r\n\r\n* One can export a Netscape-style cookies file with a browser extension ([1][9], [2][10])\r\n  and use it with the `-c` option. This comes in handy\r\n  when the authentication via password is not working (the authentication\r\n  process changes now and then).\r\n\r\n* If results show 0 sections, you most likely have provided invalid\r\n  credentials (username and/or password in the command line or in your\r\n  `.netrc` file).\r\n\r\n* For courses that have not started yet, but have had a previous iteration\r\n  sometimes a preview is available, containing all the classes from the last\r\n  course. These files can be downloaded by passing the `--preview`\r\n  parameter.\r\n\r\n* If you get an error like `Could not find class: <CLASS_NAME>`, then:\r\n    * Verify that the name of the course is correct. Current class\r\n    names in coursera are composed by a short course name e.g. `class` and\r\n    the current version of the course (a number). For example, for a\r\n    class named `class`, you would have to use `class-001`, `class-002`\r\n    etc.\r\n    * Second, verify that you are enrolled in the course. You won't be\r\n    able to access the course materials if you are not officially\r\n    enrolled and agreed to the honor course *via the website*.\r\n\r\n* If:\r\n    * You get an error when using `-n` to specify that you want to use a\r\n      `.netrc` file and,\r\n    * You want the script to use your default netrc file and,\r\n    * You get a message saying `coursera-dl: error: too few arguments`  \r\n    \r\n      Then you should specify `--` as an argument after `-n`, that is, `-n --`\r\n      or change the order in which you pass the arguments to the script, so that\r\n      the argument after `-n` begins with an hyphen (`-`).  Otherwise, Python's\r\n      `argparse` module will think that what you are passing is the name of the\r\n      netrc file that you want to use. See issue #162.\r\n\r\n# Filing an issue/Reporting a bug\r\n\r\nWhen reporting bugs against `coursera-dl`, please don't forget to include\r\nenough information so that you can help us help you:\r\n\r\n* Is the problem happening with the latest version of the exe?\r\n* What operating system are you using?\r\n* Which version of the script you are using? (Output of `coursera-dl.exe -v`)\r\n* What is the course that you are trying to access?\r\n* What is the precise command line that you are using (feel free to hide\r\n  your username and password with asterisks, but leave all other\r\n  information untouched).\r\n* What are the precise messages that you get? Please, use the `--debug`\r\n  option before posting the messages as a bug report. Please, copy and paste\r\n  them.  Don't reword/paraphrase the messages.\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nPlease, post bugs and issues on [github][11]. \r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.coursera.org\r\n[2]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/wget/1.11.4-1/wget-1.11.4-1-setup.exe\r\n[3]: https://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl\r\n[4]: https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.videolan.vlc\r\n[5]: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup\r\n[6]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse\r\n[7]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\r\n[8]: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6031266/962311\r\n[9]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lopabhfecdfhgogdbojmaicoicjekelh\r\n[10]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies\r\n[11]: https://github.com/nishad/coursera-dl-windows/issues\r\n[12]: https://twitter.com/jplehmann\r\n[13]: http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/20/coursera-adds-29-schools-90-courses-and-4-new-languages-to-its-online-learning-platform\r\n[14]: http://www.tunapanda.org\r\n[15]: https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python\r\n[16]: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\r\n[17]: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/\r\n[18]: http://python-distribute.org/pip_distribute.png\r\n[19]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/\r\n[20]: https://www.coursera.org/about/terms\r\n[21]: https://twitter.com/rtdbrito\r\n[22]: http://pypi.python.org/\r\n[23]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/coursera\r\n[issue213]: https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues/213\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
