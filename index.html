<h1>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> is arguably the leader in <em>massive open online courses</em> (MOOC)
with a selection of more than 300 classes from 62 different institutions <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/20/coursera-adds-29-schools-90-courses-and-4-new-languages-to-its-online-learning-platform">as of
February 2013</a>. Generous contributions by educators and institutions are
making excellent education available to many who could not afford it otherwise.
There are even non-profits with "feet on the ground" in remote areas of the
world who are helping spread the wealth.</p>

<p>This utility makes it easier to batch download lecture resources (e.g., videos, ppt,
etc) for Coursera classes.  Given one or more class names and account credentials,
it obtains week and class names from the <em>lectures</em> page, and then downloads
the related materials into appropriately named files and directories.</p>

<p>Why is this helpful?  A utility like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/wget/1.11.4-1/wget-1.11.4-1-setup.exe">wget</a> can work, but has the
following limitations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Video names have numbers in them, but this does not correspond to
the actual order.  Manually renaming them is a pain that is best left
for computers.</li>
<li>Using names from the syllabus page provides more informative names.</li>
<li>Using <code>wget</code> in a for loop picks up extra videos which are not
posted/linked, and these are sometimes duplicates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Browser extensions like <em>DownloadThemAll</em> is another possibility, but
<code>coursera-dl</code> provides more features such as appropriately named files.</p>

<p>This work was originally inspired in part by <a href="https://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a> by which
I've downloaded many other good videos such as those from Khan Academy.</p>

<h1>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Support for both regular (i.e., time-based) courses as well as on-demand
courses.</li>
<li>Intentionally detailed names, so that it will display and sort properly
on most interfaces (e.g., <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.videolan.vlc">VLC</a> or MX Video on Android devices).</li>
<li>Regex-based section (week) and lecture name filters to download only
certain resources.</li>
<li>File format extension filter to grab resource types you want.</li>
<li>Login credentials accepted on command-line or from <code>.netrc</code> file.</li>
<li>Core functionality tested on major new Windows editions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't already have one, create a <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> account and enroll in

<h2>
<a id="running-the-script" class="anchor" href="#running-the-script" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running the script</h2>

<p>Run the exe to download the materials by providing your Coursera account
credentials (e.g. email address and password or a <code>~/.netrc</code> file), the
class names, as well as any additional parameters:</p>

<pre><code>General:                     coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; modelthinking-004
On-Demand course:            coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; --on-demand calculus1
Multiple classes:            coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; saas historyofrock1-001 algo-2012-002
Filter by section name:      coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; -sf "Chapter_Four" crypto-004
Filter by lecture name:      coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; -lf "3.1_" ml-2012-002
Download only ppt files:     coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; -f "ppt" qcomp-2012-001
Use a ~/.netrc file:         coursera-dl -n -- matrix-001
Get the preview classes:     coursera-dl -n -b ni-001
Specify download path:       coursera-dl -n --path=C:\Coursera\Classes\ comnetworks-002
Display help:                coursera-dl --help
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some of the options like <code>-sf</code> and <code>-f</code> may not work with on-demand courses.
Downloading on-demand courses are mutually exclusive with regular courses.</p>

<pre><code>Maintain a list of classes in a dir:
  Initialize:              mkdir -p CURRENT/{class1,class2,..classN}
  Update:                  coursera-dl -n --path CURRENT `\ls CURRENT`
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we <em>do</em> support the new On Demand classes. You have to use the
option <code>--on-demand</code> for that purpose. You also have to download those
classes <em>separately</em> for regular, time-based classes.</p>

<p>Use of a <code>~/.netrc</code> file is a good alternative to
specifying both your username (i.e., your email address) and password every
time on the command line. To use it, simply add a line like the one below to
a file named <code>.netrc</code> in your home directory (or the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6031266/962311">equivalent</a>, if you
are using Windows) with contents like:</p>

<pre><code>machine coursera-dl login &lt;user&gt; password &lt;pass&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Create the file if it doesn't exist yet.  From then on, you can switch from
using <code>-u</code> and <code>-p</code> to simply call <code>coursera-dl</code> with the option <code>-n</code>
instead.  This is especially convenient, as typing usernames (email
addresses) and passwords directly on the command line can get tiresome (even
more if you happened to choose a "strong" password).</p>

<h2>
<a id="resuming-downloads" class="anchor" href="#resuming-downloads" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resuming downloads</h2>

<p>In default mode when you interrupt the download process by pressing
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, partially downloaded files will be deleted from your disk and
you have to start the download process from the begining. If your
download was interrupted by something other than KeyboardInterrupt
(<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) like sudden system crash, partially downloaded files will
remain on your disk and the next time you start the process again,
these files will be discraded from download list!, therefore it's your
job to delete them manually before next start. For this reason we
added an option called <code>--resume</code> which continues your downloads from
where they stopped:</p>

<pre><code>coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; --resume sdn1-001
</code></pre>

<p>This option can also be used with external downloaders:</p>

<pre><code>coursera-dl --wget -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; --resume sdn1-001
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note 1</em>: Some external downloaders use their own built-in resume feature
which may not be compatible with others, so use them at your own risk.</p>

<p><em>Note 2</em>: Remember that in resume mode, interrupted files <strong>WON'T</strong> be deleted from
your disk.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If your password contains punctuation, quotes or other "funny
characters" (e.g., <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code> and so on), then you may have to
escape them from your shell. With bash or other Bourne-shell clones (and
probably with many other shells) one of the better ways to do so is to
enclose your password in single quotes, so that you don't run into
problems.  See <a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues/213">issue #213</a> for more information.</p>

<h1>
<a id="troubleshooting" class="anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>If you have problems when downloading class materials, please try to see if
one of the following actions solve your problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure the class name you are using corresponds to the resource name
used in the URL for that class:
  <code>https://class.coursera.org/&lt;CLASS_NAME&gt;/class/index</code></p></li>
<li><p>To download an On Demand course, use the <code>--on-demand</code> option of the
program.</p></li>
<li><p>Have you tried to clean the cached cookies/credentials with the
<code>--clear-cache</code> option?</p></li>
<li><p>Note that many courses (most, perhaps?) may remove the materials after a
little while after the course is completed, while other courses may retain
the materials up to a next session/offering of the same course (to avoid
problems with academic dishonesty, apparently).
<br><br>
In short, it is not guaranteed that you will be able to download after the
course is finished and this is, unfortunately, nothing that we can help
you with.</p></li>
<li><p>One can export a Netscape-style cookies file with a browser extension (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lopabhfecdfhgogdbojmaicoicjekelh">1</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies">2</a>)
and use it with the <code>-c</code> option. This comes in handy
when the authentication via password is not working (the authentication
process changes now and then).</p></li>
<li><p>If results show 0 sections, you most likely have provided invalid
credentials (username and/or password in the command line or in your
<code>.netrc</code> file).</p></li>
<li><p>For courses that have not started yet, but have had a previous iteration
sometimes a preview is available, containing all the classes from the last
course. These files can be downloaded by passing the <code>--preview</code>
parameter.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If you get an error like <code>Could not find class: &lt;CLASS_NAME&gt;</code>, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify that the name of the course is correct. Current class
names in coursera are composed by a short course name e.g. <code>class</code> and
the current version of the course (a number). For example, for a
class named <code>class</code>, you would have to use <code>class-001</code>, <code>class-002</code>
etc.</li>
<li>Second, verify that you are enrolled in the course. You won't be
able to access the course materials if you are not officially
enrolled and agreed to the honor course <em>via the website</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If:</p>

<ul>
<li>You get an error when using <code>-n</code> to specify that you want to use a
<code>.netrc</code> file and,</li>
<li>You want the script to use your default netrc file and,</li>
<li>
<p>You get a message saying <code>coursera-dl: error: too few arguments</code>  </p>

<p>Then you should specify <code>--</code> as an argument after <code>-n</code>, that is, <code>-n --</code>
or change the order in which you pass the arguments to the script, so that
the argument after <code>-n</code> begins with an hyphen (<code>-</code>).  Otherwise, Python's
<code>argparse</code> module will think that what you are passing is the name of the
netrc file that you want to use. See issue #162.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
